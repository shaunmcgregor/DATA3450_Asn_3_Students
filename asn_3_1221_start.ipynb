    "### Part 1 - Election Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are looking at an election in a fictional province. There are 7 total elctoral districts, and the winner in each district is determined by a first-past-the-post system (what we have in Canada - the most votes wins, regardless of share). There are two parties - the Purples and the Yellows. Whoever controls the most seats will be the ruling party - so in our 2 party scenario, the party who wins 4 or more of the districts will govern. There is an election every year, they love voting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent polling indicating the expected vote share in each district is shown in the \"dist_polls\" table below. These values are a composite of several polls that the experts have combined and weighted. The \"Purple\" values show the expected vote share of the Purple party, along with the variance of that expectation and the number of polls that were combined to get that result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As well, research has shown that the vote distribution is impacted by voter turnout. In general, the more people vote, the more the vote split shifts towards the Yellow party. We have data on past elections and the results, we expect that the turnout will be in line with the past elections - or more specifically, we have no reason to expect it to differ. This impact is measured in the table in code below - that table shows the voter turnout, in a percentage, as well as the change in the Yellow party's vote share (also in percentage) as compared to the polling averages. For example, if one row showed \"52\" and \".8\", that would mean that voter turnout was 52%, and the Yellow party got .8% higher of a vote share than the polling showed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is the probability that the Purple Party controls the government after the election?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the errors and confidence intervals are not totally trivial. As part of the written answer, offer an evaluation of your confidence in the prediction, and why you think that. This is not a question with one specific error, your estimation will have some expected errors, somewhere. You may not have the tools to calculate it all the way through, that's fine. "

    "Please fill in (and extend if required) the list here to explain what you did. There are multiple reasonable things you could do to approach this, so please note what you did here. For most people I assume this will be about 3-5 statements - you don't need to explain the internals of things we covered (e.g. if there's a hypothesis test, you don't need to explain how that works), just how you structured your approach to the problem. \n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Use a linear regression to predict the \"yellow improvement\" if the voter turnout is 60%\n",
    "<li>Take the mean of the poll results per distrit and use that as the probability of getting a vote for purple\n",
    "<li>Add the \"yellow improvement\" to the proportion that purple needs to win, i.e. purple needs 53.7% of the vote to win a district as the yellow improvement is 3.7%\n",
    "<li>Simulate the election in all 7 districts (aparently 1 million times, becouse I'm bad at math)\n",
    "<li>check to see how many districts purple wins the majority of the time (2) and decide they aren't forming government if the turnout is 60%\n",
    "<li> <b> What do you think about the error/accuracy:</b> the RMSE was about 1.6% across all districts, this brings a few CIs to include the win % of 53.7 which makes me think this isn't as clear cut of a loss as it seems. I also didn't love getting the mean of the polling, I thought that it wasn't quite right but the other way I tried it (random value between lowest poll amount and highest poll amount) created too much variation in results. If I had more time I might find a way to randomly select a specific poll and use those numbers instead of the mean. CI of 6% also seem high to me there is a big difference between getting 51% of the vote and getting 57% of the vote.\n",
